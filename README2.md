# Adjusted Things README File:

# Question 7:
#### The error I originally had on my code was that I had only 1 join statement, the correct way to do it is with 2 join statements.


# Question 10:
#### In my original code, I had a subquery within the USING statement which would've messed up the logic of the code. The correct way to do it is without a subquery in the USING statement and instead just using boohbah_stand_link l.
